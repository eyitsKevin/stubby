#PCB Revision.  Set to 1 for 1.x, 2 for 2.x, etc.
#Defaults to 2
#PCB_REVISION=2

#Is a magnetometer on board?  Set to 1 for yes, 0 for no.
#Defaults to 1
#MAGNETOMETER=1

#The orientation of the magnetometer.  This value will be added to the output heading
# to make 0 point North.  For rev 2.1 (and 2.0 if you mount the Adafruit magnetometer
# in the recommended way) boards, this is PI radians (180 degrees).
#MAGNETOMETER_ORIENTATION_OFFSET=3.1415926

#Is a distance sensor on board?  Set to 1 for yes, 0 for no.
#Defaults to 1
#DISTANCE_SENSOR=1

#Manually set the F_CPU speed.  Only do this if you are using a non-standard value
# (i.e. something other than 20MHz for Rev2 boards, or 12MHz for Rev1 boards).
#Defaults to the nominal value for the specified board revision.
#F_CPU=20000000

#Manually set the TWI_FREQ speed.  Only do this if you are having problems with the default
# (most likely happening if you don't have high enough pull-ups on SDA / SCL).
#Defaults to 400000L
#TWI_FREQ=400000L

#Change the AVR programmer if needed.  Defaults to usbtiny
#AVRDUDE_PROGRAMMER=stk500v2

#Change the AVR Programmer port if needed.  Defaults to nothing (as usbtiny uses USB VID/PID)
#AVRDUDE_PORT=
