 * link agnostic; thus, there are a few functions which you need to implement to link this library into your communications.

 * must be called from the main code.

 * This function MUST be implemented by the calling code.  This function will be called from protocol_receive_byte when
 * the final byte of a given message has arrived and the checksum is validated.
 * 
 * A possible implementation would be to read the incoming message and put it in a mailbox for later use; another possible 
 * implementation would be to immediately consume the message and act on it.  This function should be as quick as possible
 * to ensure that a new incoming message does not clobber the existing message before it has been consumed.  If you have 
 * flow control, it MAY be good to disable other incoming messages until this message has been handled.
