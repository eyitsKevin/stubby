//The distance from 0,0 at which legs are mounted.  This assumes a radial symmetry of all legs (i.e. the distance
// is the same for all the legs); if this does not apply to your design, you will need to pass in an x,y offset for
// each leg in its constructor, and modify the translation function to use it.  See figure 1.1, 'leg offset'
#define LEG_OFFSET						45
//The angle offset for a single leg.  All legs are defined as a multiple of this number.  For the current design
// (radial symmetry, with the middle leg sticking straight out the side) this should be 60 degrees.  See

//For the Coxa joint we just use a linear equation to determine the offsets, since it is close enough for
// most purposes and eliminates a lot of math needed for the drive system calculations.  To determine
// this value, set the coxa joint on a single leg to various phases (for instance, 1500 + 300, 1500 - 300, 
// 1500 + 600, etc) and measure the resulting angles.  On my robot, I get approx. 16 degrees for each
// phase offset of 300us.  By dividing this out (300 / (16 * PI / 180)) I get the value 1074.296, which 
// means that for each radian I want to move, I adjust the phase by 1074.296.
